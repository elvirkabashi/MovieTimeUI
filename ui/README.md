# MovieTime

## Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing movie viewing preferences. Users can maintain a record of the films they have watched, curate a wishlist of desired movies, rate the films they have seen, and leave comments for others considering watching the same movie. The system is designed to cater to two distinct user roles: regular users and administrators.

### User Functionality

Regular users have access to features such as:
- Keeping track of watched movies
- Creating and managing a wishlist of desired films
- Rating movies based on personal preference
- Leaving comments to guide other users in their viewing decisions

### Admin Dashboard

Administrators have access to a dashboard with detailed insights, including:
- Recent additions to the movie database
- Latest user ratings
- Movies with the highest ratings
- Newly registered users
- User management options, such as activating or deactivating accounts

## Usage

To utilize the system, users can sign up for an account, log in, and start adding movies to their watched list or wishlist. They can rate movies and provide feedback to enhance the community experience. Administrators have additional privileges to manage the system and oversee user activity.
